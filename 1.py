"""
algorithm : Arranging clothes in an almirah 

STEP 1 : Start the algorithm.

STEP 2 : Input the total n number of shelves available in the almirah.

STEP 3 : Create a list of all clothes to be stored in the almirah.

STEP 4 : Categorize the clothes into different types such as :
          -Formal 
          -casual
	      -Traditional
	      -seasonal

STEP 5 : Determine the frequency of usage for each clothing category.

STEP 6 : Sort the clothing categories based on frequency of use, from MOST frequently used to LEAST frequently used.

STEP 7 : Assign shelves to each clothing category based on : frequency of use & Available shelf space

STEP 8 : Allocate easily reachable shelves for frequently used clothes to minimize the time required to find them.

STEP 9 : Allocate upper or lower shelves for less frequently used clothes.

STEP 10: Arrange clothes neatly on each shelf by :
	 -folding clothes properly 
	 -stacking similar clothes together.
	 -avoiding empty space to optimize space utilization.

STEP 11: Ensure that clothes of the same category are stored together to reduce searching time.

STEP 12: If required, label shelves with clothing categories for easy identification.  

STEP 13: Verify that all clothes are placed properly and shelf space is optimally utilized.

STEP 14: End the algorithm.
